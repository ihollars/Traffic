# Traffic Models


## Problem
Most are familiar with different road intersection designs such as the 4-way stop, traffic light, and roundabout. The purpose of our model(s) is to determine what 4-way intersection design leads to optimal traffic flow. This problem was inspired by https://www.contest.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/contests/2009/problems/ . 

It is known that roundabouts are able to handle larger volumes of traffic than traffic lights and 4-way stops. We analyze our models against this pattern. 



## Models
* circle.nlogo models a standard traffic circle
* bad_circle.nlogo models a traffic circle where circling traffic yields to incoming cars
* lightv1.nlogo models a traffic light where each entering road is given a turn to let its cars go
* 4way_naive.nlogo models a 4-way stop


## Analysis 
The analysis can be found in the data folder. 

## Results

Variable speed (or a stop/start penalty) and realistic dimensions are important features of modeling an intersection. These should be added for further analysis.
