# Traffic Models

We plan on implementing several models to answer some basic questions. 

* Which is the better circle protocol (yield in or yield while going around)?
* How do the performances of traffic circles compare to other 4-way models: traffic light and 4-way stop? 
* How does this change as number of cars vary? 
* How often should traffic lights change?
